# Introduction
Enter your OpenAI API Key to view the costs consumed by various model APIs over the past day.

# Security
The code is open-source and will not store your privacy.

# Run Yourself
Clone this project, run below in command line:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
python app.py
```

# Contribution
The initial intention of this project is to facilitate myself: When the cost is abnormal, it allows me to conveniently check where the high consumption is, so the current features are rather rudimentary. If you have better display forms and requirements, you are welcome to submit a PR.
